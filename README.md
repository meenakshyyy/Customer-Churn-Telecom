## Abstract
### Customer churn is the number of customers who stop using a company's products or services over a given period of time. Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next.Customers are the most important resources for any companies or businessed. What if these customers leave the company due to high charges, better compititor offers, poor customer services or something unknown, which indirectyly shows company's performance. Hence, Customer churn is one of the important metrics for companies to evaluate their performance.  This data science project aims to predict customer churn by analyzing behavioral, demographic, and transactional data using machine learning techniques.

### Project involves collecting and preprocessing data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineering features that capture key customer behaviors such as usage patterns, billing trends, and customer support interactions. A range of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are evaluated for their predictive performance using metrics and performing deployment using streamlit.

### The project delivers actionable insights that help telecom companies reduce churn rates, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase profitability. By integrating predictive analytics into business operations, this solution supports data-driven decision-making and sustainable growth.
